# Mireia Galindo - Data Science Portfolio

## About
I am an Architect and a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast with strong skills in data analysis and visualization using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, as well as SQL and Power BI. I have hands-on experience developing machine learning models to solve complex problems.

With over 10 years of experience in construction projects—ranging from residential and industrial to office developments—I excel in problem-solving, client communication, and coordinating efforts among stakeholders and planners.

Additionally, I have training in Smart Cities and technologies for effective urban management. I am passionate about integrating design, technology, and sustainability to drive innovation and create impactful solutions.
