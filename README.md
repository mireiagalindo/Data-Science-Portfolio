# Mireia Galindo - Data Science Portfolio

## About
I’m an architect with a strong background in designing and executing diverse building projects, and a Data Science and Machine Learning professional with expertise in Python-based analysis and visualization, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, along with working knowledge of SQL and Power BI. I have hands-on experience developing machine learning models to solve complex problems effectively.

With over 10 years of experience in construction projects—spanning residential, industrial, and office developments—I excel in problem-solving, client communication, and coordinating efforts among stakeholders and planners.

Additionally, I have formal training in Smart Cities and technologies for effective urban management. I am deeply passionate about integrating design, technology, and sustainability to drive innovation and create impactful, future-focused solutions.
