## About
I’m an architect with a strong background in designing and executing diverse building projects, and a Data Science and Machine Learning professional with expertise in Python-based analysis and visualization, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, along with working knowledge of SQL and Power BI. I have hands-on experience developing machine learning models to solve complex problems effectively.

With over 10 years of experience in construction projects—spanning residential, industrial, and office developments—I excel in problem-solving, client communication, and coordinating efforts among stakeholders and planners.

Additionally, I have formal training in Smart Cities and technologies for effective urban management. I am deeply passionate about integrating design, technology, and sustainability to drive innovation and create impactful, future-focused solutions.

Organized by complexity, from simple to complex: 

### Used BMW Car Sales

#### **Description:** 
This project involves preprocessing and analyzing a used BMW car sales dataset to predict car prices. It includes handling missing values, removing outliers, feature engineering, and exploring data relationships through EDA. The goal is to prepare the data for an effective price prediction model.

#### **Skills:** 
Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Outlier Detection, Data Cleaning and Transformation, Data Visualization, Machine Learning Model Preparation, Statistical Analysis. 

#### **Technology:** 
Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

### Microsoft Malware Prediction 

**Description:** 
This project focuses on using machine learning to predict malware infections on devices. The goal is to analyze historical data related to system behavior, software usage, and security vulnerabilities, to create a  predictive models that can identify which systems are at risk of becoming compromised. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation and Model Training and Evaluation. 

**Skills:** Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Outlier Detection, Data Cleaning and Transformation, Data Visualization, Machine Learning Model Preparation, Statistical Analysis.

**Technology:** 
Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).

**Code:** [`Microsoft_Malware_Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/mireiagalindo/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Microsoft_Malware_Prediction.ipynb)


### 3. Sales Prediction with Time Series and XGBoost. 

**Description:** 
This project focuses on predicting monthly sales using time series data and an XGBoost model. The dataset contains sales data for various items across multiple shops, and the goal is to forecast future sales. The process involves data loading, exploration, handling missing values, feature engineering, and building predictive models using XGBoost. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes visualizing sales trends, item categories, and cities with the highest sales. Key features are created through rolling averages, lag features, and aggregated metrics to improve model performance. The XGBoost model is trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned using RMSE for performance measurement.

**Skills:**
Time Series Analysis, Data Cleaning & Imputation, Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Building and Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Deployment. 

**Technology:**
Python, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization), Scikit-learn (Metrics & Preprocessing), Statsmodels (Time Series Plots).
